Helloo.
Microservices and big-dataaaaaaaa increasingly confront us with the limitations of traditional input/output.
In traditional IO, woork that is IO-bound dominates threads.
This woooouldn't be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensiveee on the JVM, and most other platforms.
Even if threads were cheap and infinitelyyy scalable, we'd still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks.
Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways.
Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions.
We need something better.
